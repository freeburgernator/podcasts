              <p class="card-text">I am often intrigued by the judeochristian ideas which are embedded in our western culture.
                The doctor realizes that he is helping those who would not help him. The commander attempts to quote the Lord's prayer. In the end,
                he literally gives blood his blood to save the life of his enemy: the agent of damnation and that agent of salvation. Beautiful.</p>

              <p class="card-text">More things which we believe are reality are the results of other processes in our brain.
              This is our "hard wiring," and is probably impossible for us to change. Consider the colors you see: these were
              never taught to you, but something you have always known. They are hard wired. It is very fair to assume that
              we are under the influence of our own interpretations of reality, and those interpretations may be flawed. Based upon
              this understanding, we must doubt that we can be so quick to believe that the other person must see "reality" in the same way we do.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I recall sitting with a homeless man in Austin once. I had talked to him several times before.
              He admitted to me that he suffered from visual delusions. You should know that visual delusions are not like
              smudges that appear in your vision when you rube your eyes, but things that appear as real as everything else.
              Its not a mirage, its an actual building - except the building doesn't exist. While he was telling me this, he said
              he could see skulls in the pavement. He looked longingly at me and stated that he knew there weren't skulls there - he still
              had his logic with him, why would anyone put skulls in the pavenment - but he could not trust his eyes. He also told me he had
              been raped by the police. He would not know what reality was.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I used to hate art - seeing art, critisizing art, doing art. That's because I thought that art was paintings
              of nobles from the 17th century. Then someone came and taught me how art was made, why art was made, and what art encompassed. I wouldn't
              say that I "love" art, but I certainly consume a lot more of it, and am happier for it. Maybe I was just missing something before. Maybe
              beauty is taught.</p>

              But as the world series was going on as I stood patiently waiting on the laundry machine to finish in chicago laundrymat, I decided to give it a listen
              and was not disappointed. Rather than tell the stories of the superstarts, they focused on the stories of obscurity. I listened to the entire series
              over the summer, but this one stood out the most.</p>

              I luckily had the ability to get back into my car, drive with my license, and get waved through the checkpoints as I
              answered "yessir" to the "are you all US citizens?" in my American accent. I cannot imagine the desparation that drives
              people to walk through this desert - but I would say that if you are desparate enough to walk through that desert, you are
              no different than the select number of my ancestors who crossed the sea to get here - and if they are willing to cross that
              desert to get here, they are probably willing to do what it takes to be a profitable citizen for America. I don't advocate for
              open borders, but an expanse of desert is not an open door. Anyone who has been there can tell you that.</p>
