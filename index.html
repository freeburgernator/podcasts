              <p class="card-text">I am often intrigued by the judeochristian ideas which are embedded in our western culture.
                The doctor realizes that he is helping those who would not help him. The commander attempts to quote the Lord's prayer. In the end,
                he literally gives blood his blood to save the life of his enemy: the agent of damnation and that agent of salvation. Beautiful.</p>

              <p class="card-text">More things which we believe are reality are the results of other processes in our brain.
              This is our "hard wiring," and is probably impossible for us to change. Consider the colors you see: these were
              never taught to you, but something you have always known. They are hard wired. It is very fair to assume that
              we are under the influence of our own interpretations of reality, and those interpretations may be flawed. Based upon
              this understanding, we must doubt that we can be so quick to believe that the other person must see "reality" in the same way we do.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I recall sitting with a homeless man in Austin once. I had talked to him several times before.
              He admitted to me that he suffered from visual delusions. You should know that visual delusions are not like
              smudges that appear in your vision when you rube your eyes, but things that appear as real as everything else.
              Its not a mirage, its an actual building - except the building doesn't exist. While he was telling me this, he said
              he could see skulls in the pavement. He looked longingly at me and stated that he knew there weren't skulls there - he still
              had his logic with him, why would anyone put skulls in the pavenment - but he could not trust his eyes. He also told me he had
              been raped by the police. He would not know what reality was.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I used to hate art - seeing art, critisizing art, doing art. That's because I thought that art was paintings
              of nobles from the 17th century. Then someone came and taught me how art was made, why art was made, and what art encompassed. I wouldn't
              say that I "love" art, but I certainly consume a lot more of it, and am happier for it. Maybe I was just missing something before. Maybe
              beauty is taught.</p>

              But as the world series was going on as I stood patiently waiting on the laundry machine to finish in chicago laundrymat, I decided to give it a listen
              and was not disappointed. Rather than tell the stories of the superstarts, they focused on the stories of obscurity. I listened to the entire series
              over the summer, but this one stood out the most.</p>

              I luckily had the ability to get back into my car, drive with my license, and get waved through the checkpoints as I
              answered "yessir" to the "are you all US citizens?" in my American accent. I cannot imagine the desparation that drives
              people to walk through this desert - but I would say that if you are desparate enough to walk through that desert, you are
              no different than the select number of my ancestors who crossed the sea to get here - and if they are willing to cross that
              desert to get here, they are probably willing to do what it takes to be a profitable citizen for America. I don't advocate for
              open borders, but an expanse of desert is a literal trial by fire. Anyone who has been there can tell you that.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Humans have always been in a battle with our creations. Do we conform to the machine, or does the machine conform to us?
              With the industrial revolution, a whole wave of philosophers became concerned with this question. Now, that idea has existed the zeitgeist but is
              perhaps even more applicable. I find it strange that humans used to create statues that could defend themselves and called them "gods," and now
              we create intellegence capable of inflicting harm through human hands and we do not call that a "god."</p>
              <p class="card-text font-italic">What machines do you conform to in your life?</p>
              <p class="card-text font-italic">What systems may be controlling your life but not guided by humans?</p>

              <p class="card-text">I've never been this angry or this violent, but when I listen to the horrors this boy has gone through, I can understand.
              I have lost people close to me, and I had a loving and caring family. This boy didn't get that from his biological family, so of course he found
              it in another family. I would have done the same. I wouldn't have wanted someone to help me. I wouldn't have wanted someone to teach me a lesson.
              I wouldn't have said something like "all I needed is love" - but that does not change the fact that this boy, now man, could have been so much better off if
              we desinged a system to redeem these boys instead of condemn them. This man does right to fight for redemption. We do wrong to condemn them. We should stop.</p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">The American Life</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Soon after my father died, I began to make jokes about the agent of this death, a lasagna. That story is too long
              for this venue, but needless to say that some people take my humor as being in bad taste, as if my making light of the situation somehow
              means that I did not love or care for my father.</p>
              <p class="card-text">To those people, I would ask how they form that opinion. Is that what they have been taught? Who taught them that? What
              trama have they experienced that makes them an expert on how people experience trauma? And beyond that, what makes them an expert on how I process trauma?</p>
              <p class="card-text">What I am most shocked by is not just that the elderly women in this story must justify their doubt, but that they cannot say that they
              had no reason to doubt. Is their guilt so great that you must still worm your way out of it by blaming the victim? How would they know what they would do in the
              aftermath of such trauma?</p>
              <p class="card-text">My trauma was quite minor in comparison to this story of trauma - but I remember yearning for the world to return to normal. I
              heard that same yearn listening to this story, and perhaps that's why I take the doubters continued attempts at exoneration so damnable. At least Thomas would later die for Christ.</p>
              <p class="card-text font-italic">Have you ever doubted someone's trauma because of the way they acted?</p>
              <p class="card-text font-italic">When is it right to call someone a liar?</p>

              <p class="card-text">Odysseus was tied to a mast to avoid being lured to his death by the Sirens. His crew filled thier ears with wax so they would
              follow the beautiful music to their deaths. Perhaps the ancient people who actually sailed to and from Troy in what was appearently a real war watched their captain have an epileptic seizure and made this story which has been passed to us
              in this form. Perhaps those ancient people knew the Sirens were not creatures but could not give a name to the malady we call something else today.
              Perhaps the Sirens were as real to them as they are to us.</p>
